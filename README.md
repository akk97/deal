Deal or No Deal Game

I’ve always loved playing *Deal or No Deal* in arcades, so I decided to build my own web-based version of the game from scratch.  
This version features **20 cases**, with **bank offers after each round** based on expected value calculations, and a final round where the player chooses between their personal case and the last one remaining.  

To make the game more accessible and engaging, I transitioned from a command-line interface to a **fully interactive front end** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with data stored in **local storage** for persistence and analysis.  

Beyond coding, this project reflects my **product management skills**:  
I prioritized **user experience** by replicating the original arcade feel, scoped features **iteratively** for development efficiency, and laid the groundwork for **data-informed insights**.  

I’m also working on a **machine learning component** that predicts optimal game moves—an innovation driven by my desire to “beat the game” and add strategic depth.  

This end-to-end project showcases my ability to combine **technical execution** with **product vision**, **iteration**, and **user-centric thinking**.
